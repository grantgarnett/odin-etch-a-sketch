# odin-etch-a-sketch
This is an etch a sketch web application completed as a part of the Odin Project curriculum. The original instructions called for the 'drawing' to take place in response to the motion of the mouse, but we have modified the code so that the mouse must also be pressed, to improve the flexibility and experience of the application.
