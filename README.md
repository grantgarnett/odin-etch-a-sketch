# odin-etch-a-sketch
This is an etch a sketch web application completed as a part of the Odin Project curriculum. The original instructions called for 'drawing' to happen indiscriminately in response to the motion of the mouse, but we've modified the code so that this happens when the mouse is pressed, to improve the flexibility and experience of the application.
